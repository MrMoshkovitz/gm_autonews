I want to create a project that gathers a user's favorite categories and specific news sources, then generates two outputs based on the retrieved content:
1. A **5-minute podcast script** summarizing the key points from the articles.
2. A **newsletter** containing summarized versions of the articles, formatted for easy reading.

### Project Details:
- **User Input**: Allow users to select their favorite categories and news sources dynamically (e.g., `{categories}`, `{news_source}`).
- **Task 1 (Podcast)**: Design a process that:
  - Scrapes or fetches news articles based on user preferences.
  - Summarizes the key points into a coherent script for a 5-minute podcast.
  - Ensure the script has a clear flow, engaging tone, and concise summaries.
- **Task 2 (Newsletter)**: Create a process that:
  - Summarizes the articles into a brief but informative newsletter.
  - Ensure the format is visually appealing, with clear sections for each category or news source.
  
### Expected Output:
- **Podcast Script**: A well-structured 5-minute script summarizing the articles, ready to be recorded.
- **Newsletter**: A visually structured and concise newsletter summarizing the same articles.

### Tools & Agents:
- Utilize an agent for **content scraping** or fetching articles from the specified sources.
- Use a **Summarizer agent** to condense the information from each article.
- Employ a **Writer agent** to organize the podcast script and format the newsletter.
- Optionally, integrate external tools (APIs) for fetching real-time news or using summarization models.

### Memory & Dynamic Input:
- Agents should retain user preferences (categories, news sources) to allow for easy reuse in future interactions.
- Use dynamic variables such as `{categories}` and `{news_source}` for customizations in both outputs.

Design and help me plan this project by outlining the specific components, tools, and steps needed.

Please use GPT-3.5 Turbo	for the summarization and
I want to create a detailed task-based working plan for developing the project that gathers a user's favorite categories and specific news sources, then generates:

A 5-minute podcast script summarizing key points from the articles.
A newsletter containing summarized versions of the articles.
Developer Task Breakdown:
Break the project into as many small steps as possible.
Each step should be treated as a Developer Ticket with clear instructions and expected outcomes.
For each ticket, include:
Task Description: What the developer needs to accomplish.
Expected Result: What the final output of the task should look like.
Dependencies: If the task depends on other tasks, list them.
Interaction:
We will work interactively, so the plan should allow me to follow along and interact with each step.
Create the plan in a markdown file for easy reference and tracking.
Working Plan Requirements:
Divide the process into multiple developer tickets.
Each ticket should have a clear, small, and actionable step, allowing the project to progress incrementally.
Ensure that the developer's tasks cover:
User Input Handling (collecting categories and news sources).
Content Scraping from specific news sources.
Summarization of the articles for both the podcast script and newsletter.
Podcast Script Generation.
Newsletter Formatting.
Include space for feedback and adjustments at each step.
Example Ticket Structure:
Task Description: Scrape news articles based on user preferences.
Expected Result: Code that retrieves articles from a specified news source based on given categories.
Dependencies: Requires user input collection functionality.
Output:
Provide the plan as a markdown file that I can review, with each developer ticket clearly outlined.
We will proceed step-by-step, and I will interact with each task as the development process unfolds.





To plan the development of your project step-by-step, I’ll break it down into small, actionable tickets, each with a specific goal, expected output, and any dependencies. The project involves creating a system that scrapes or fetches news articles, summarizes them for a podcast script and newsletter, and dynamically adapts to user input for categories and news sources.

I’ll prepare this as a markdown document for easy tracking and review.
